# Bike Rental Case Study
> The objective was to create a Regression Equation that would provide Boom Bikes, provider of “ready to ride” bike services in the United States, an understanding of the potential demand for its services, meet the related requirements and bounce back post the Pandemic.

## General Information
Welcome to my first Linear Regression assignment in Python, my earlier projects / assignments have been in R!

What helped in this endeavour was the very good mix of numerical and categorical data. There was data that needed treatment (Eg: reclassifying the weather situation), but that is what added layers to the project. 

Given the requirement to create a robust model, one had to go through multiple, as many as 11 iterations!

I have also gone a little ahead and included a very short section on Business implications. This was a great case of being a success within a year of operation, it is hence important to evolve what is working, to Best Practices. 

## Conclusions
1.	Temperature (an obvious positive influence), as mentioned earlier on. After “constant”, has the highest coefficient value. And a t-score of 13.761.
2.	The Year. At least for this data set. It is more of an indicator of the good service during the inaugural year (2018) that has led to a higher rental count during the second year (2019). The high t-score of 27.002 bears this out. 
3.	Weathersit (The Weather Situation). The worse it is, the less are the rentals (notice the difference in negative coefficients between Moderate and Bad Weather). And the negative t-score of -10.360.
